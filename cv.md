## A little bit about yourself:

From early childhood I wanted to become a programmer, I still can't explain my craving for this profession, but here I am. After graduating from high school, I tried to go to college as a general programmer, but the group was closed and I had to get the profession of a civil engineer. Many years later I decided to do programming again and my choice fell on front-end development and in particular on JS. By all means, I will go through this path to the end. Thank you for your attention!
